# AutomatedMouseMover
This is a simple and small tool for those who are working from (for) home and stll want to remain online. 
Please be aware that use of this tool might be addictive and you might spend your productive hours in watching a movie ;). 
Happy Work From Home!!!

Concept:
This tool simply moves the mouse attached to your machine at randon locations on the desktop every 5 secs. This ensure that your
system is not idle more than 5 secs and hence prevents auto locks and/or idle status.

Features:
Nothing fancy! Initiates with a small form to enter your organizaion name. This name will be used to create a taskbar icon
in order to stop the application. e.g. if your company name is "Sandeep", you will see a taskbar item "sandeep" with standard icon.
To stop the application:
There are couple of ways:
1. Right Click on the taskbar item e.g."Sandeep" and click on exit. To use this option you need to make sure the exiting is done within 5 secs
2. If the taskbar item is in focus,simple press any key from the keyboard, the application will be closed.


Thats it for this release. Happy coding and enjoy your time at home with family and/or with your Television/XBox etc.
